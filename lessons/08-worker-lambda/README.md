## Lesson 08 — Worker Lambda


### Goal

In this lesson we will learn how to consume messages from an SQS queue, how to write Lambda function that run on a schedule and finally, how to inject external parameters during deploy (e.g. API tokens or other secrets).

If you are already familiar with those concepts you can use the following Cloudformation template to apply the changes expected by this lesson and move forward to the next lesson.

**TODO**: add Cloudformation template
