## Lesson 08 â€” Worker Lambda


### Goal

In this lesson we will learn how to consume messages from an SQS queue, how to write Lambda function that run on a schedule and finally, how to inject external parameters during deploy (e.g. API tokens or other secrets).

If you are already familiar with those concepts you can use the following Cloudformation template to apply the changes expected by this lesson and move forward to the next lesson.

**TODO**: add Cloudformation template

## 08.01 - Consuming messages from an SQS queue

You can consume a message from an SQS queue in a Lambda function by using the AWS
SDK.

The idea is that you start by pulling the queue for one or more messages, then you process the received payload,
finally when the processing is done, you remove the message(s) from the queue to mark the job as
completed.

SQS, in fact, by default will put messages back in the queue if they are not deleted by the worker.
This happens because the worker might crash before completing the processing of the message and the
queue tries to protect you from losing messages.

Using the AWS SDK, you can pull for a message as follows:

```javascript
const AWS = require('aws-sdk')
const sqs = new AWS.SQS()

const receiveMessageParams = {
  QueueUrl: '<QueueURL>',
  MaxNumberOfMessages: 1
}

sqs.receiveMessage(receiveMessageParams, (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err)
  } else {
    if (data.Messages) {
      // some message was received
      console.log(data.Messages)
    } else {
      console.log('No message available')
    }
  }
})
```

If messages are fetched, `data.Messages` will be an array of messages.

Since our messages are originally coming from SNS, the structure of data received from
SQS will look like the following:

```json
{
  "Messages": [
    {
      "Body": "{\n  \"Type\" : \"Notification\",\n  \"MessageId\" : \"abcdef01-2345-6789-0abc-defg123456783\",\n  \"TopicArn\" : \"arn:aws:sns:eu-west-1:123456789012:ticketless-ticketPurchased\",\n  \"Message\" : \"{\\\"ticket\\\":{\\\"id\\\":\\\"abcdef01-2345-6789-0abc-defg123456784\\\",\\\"createdAt\\\":1509980177897,\\\"name\\\":\\\"Alex Smith\\\",\\\"email\\\":\\\"email@example.com\\\",\\\"gig\\\":\\\"nirvana-cork-1991\\\"},\\\"gig\\\":{\\\"capacity\\\":2300,\\\"collectionPoint\\\":\\\"29 South Main Street, Centre, Cork City, Co. Cork, Ireland\\\",\\\"collectionTime\\\":\\\"13:00\\\",\\\"slug\\\":\\\"nirvana-cork-1991\\\",\\\"originalDate\\\":\\\"1991-08-20\\\",\\\"venue\\\":\\\"Cavern Club\\\",\\\"bandName\\\":\\\"Nirvana\\\",\\\"city\\\":\\\"Cork\\\",\\\"date\\\":\\\"2019-06-21\\\",\\\"image\\\":\\\"nirvana.jpg\\\",\\\"year\\\":\\\"1991\\\",\\\"collectionPointMap\\\":\\\"map-nirvana-cork-1991.png\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"Lorem Ipsum\\\",\\\"price\\\":\\\"1666.60\\\"}}\",\n  \"Timestamp\" : \"2017-11-06T14:56:18.123Z\",\n  \"SignatureVersion\" : \"1\",\n  \"Signature\" : \"someRandomLongString\",\n  \"SigningCertURL\" : \"https://sns.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/SimpleNotificationService-12345678.pem\",\n  \"UnsubscribeURL\" : \"https://sns.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/?Action=Unsubscribe&SubscriptionArn=arn:aws:sns:eu-west-1:123456789012:ticketless-ticketPurchased:abcdef01-2345-6789-0abc-defg123456785\"\n}",
      "ReceiptHandle": "someRandomLongString",
      "MD5OfBody": "abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890",
      "MessageId": "abcdef01-2345-6789-0abc-defg12345678"
    }
  ]
}
```

So in order to get the real content of the message you will need to JSON-parse-itâ„¢
twice as follows:


```javascript
const fistMessage = data.Messages[0]
const firstMessageContent = JSON.parse(JSON.parse(fistMessage.Body).Message)
```

In order to acknowledge SQS that a message was processed and delete it from the queue,
you can use the AWS SDK as follows:

```javascript
const AWS = require('aws-sdk')
const sqs = new AWS.SQS()

const deleteMessageParams = {
  QueueUrl: '<QueueURL>',
  ReceiptHandle: '<ReceiptHandle>' // Every message has a `ReceiptHandle` property
}

sqs.deleteMessage(deleteMessageParams, (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err)
  }

  console.log('message deleted successfully')
})
```


## 08.02 - Sending emails from Node.js / Lambda

As part of this lesson we will need to send an email from a Lambda function.

AWS offers a complete service for sending transactional emails called
[Simple Email Service (SES)](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/).

Although this is the right service to use in production for sending emails in the
AWS cloud, it takes sometime to be configured and you will need a custom domain registered.

Also, for the sake of this tutorial, we don't really need to send real email to real people,
so a simple SMTP test server is more than enough for our purposes.

A very good (and mostly free) cloud based SMTP test server is [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io).

You can quickly create a free account on Mailtrap using you GitHub profile and, then,
from your online panel be sure to copy somewhere the following parameters as we will need them
later:

  - `Host`:	smtp.mailtrap.io
  - `Port`:	25 or 465 or 2525 (use 465)
  - `Username`:	xxx
  - `Password`:	yyy

In order to send emails from Node.js we can use the [nodemailer](http://npm.im/nodemailer) module
in combination with the [nodemailer-smtp-transport](http://npm.im/nodemailer-smtp-transport) companion module.

Here's a quick 'n dirty example on how to send a quick email with `nodemailer` using
SMTP:

```javascript
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer')
const smtpTransport = require('nodemailer-smtp-transport')

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport(smtpTransport({
  host: 'somehost.com',
  port: 465,
  auth: {
    user: 'arthur',
    pass: 'conan doyle'
  }
}))

const mailOptions = {
  from: 'some@one.com',
  to: 'somebody@else.com',
  subject: 'Just catching up...',
  text: 'Hey how are you today?'
}

transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (err, info) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err)
  } else {
    console.log('Mail sent successfully!')
  }
})
```


## 08.03 - Managing configuration in Lambda

It should be pretty much obvious at this point that we need a way to manage configuration parameters
coming from the outside.

Ideally we don't want to embed these parameters directly in our `template.yaml`, but
have some facility to inject them from the outside at deploy time, maybe from environment variables.

Turns out that in SAM (and in Cloudformation), there is the concept of generic parameters.

That's how we can add all the parameters we need for this lesson in our `template.yaml`:


```yaml
# ...
Parameters:
  SmtpHost:
    Description: The SMTP Host to send emails
    Type: String
  SmtpPort:
    Description: The port for the SMTP server (generally 25 or 465)
    Type: Number
    Default: 465
  SmtpSenderAddress:
    Description: "The email address to send emails from"
    Type: String
  SmtpUsername:
    Description: "The username to authenticate to the SMTP server"
    Type: String
  SmtpPassword:
    Description: "The password to authenticate to the SMTP server"
    Type: String

Resources:
# ...
```

From now on, every time we deploy we have to specify values for these parameters,
which is a bit annoying.

A strategy I often use in those cases is to create a file called `.env` (which I immediately add
to my `.gitignore` to make sure I don't commit it by mistake! ðŸ˜…) that contains
the values for all the variables:

```bash
# .env
export SMTP_HOST="smtp.mailtrap.io"
export SMTP_PORT="465"
export SMTP_SENDER_ADDRESS="staff@ticketless.com"
export SMTP_USERNAME="xxx"
export SMTP_PASSWORD="yyy"
```

Now when you start your development session you can run:

```bash
source .env
```

This will load all the sensitive values as environment variables in your current session.

So now, for the entire duration of your shell session you can use the following command to deploy:

```bash
sam deploy \
  --region eu-west-1 \
  --template-file packaged.yaml \
  --stack-name $STACK_NAME \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
  --parameter-overrides \
    "SmtpHost=$SMTP_HOST" \
    "SmtpPort=$SMTP_PORT" \
    "SmtpSenderAddress=$SMTP_SENDER_ADDRESS" \
    "SmtpUsername=$SMTP_USERNAME" \
    "SmtpPassword=$SMTP_PASSWORD"
```

> ðŸ’¡ **TIP**: You can update your deploy script (if you created one previously) to
include these changes.

> ðŸ’¡ **TIP**: In real production apps it can be a good idea to store these parameters
in AWS by using dedicated services like [Systems Manager Parameter Store](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html) or [Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config). With those services you can also store these values as encrypted strings
and fine tune the level of access to different users or systems.


## 08.04 - Create worker lambda

We need to define the role (so that the lambda can read from the queue and delete messages)

In template.yaml

```yaml
SendMailWorkerRole:
    Type: "AWS::IAM::Role"
    Properties:
      ManagedPolicyArns:
        - "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole"
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Version: "2012-10-17"
        Statement:
          - Sid: "AllowLambdaServiceToAssumeRole"
            Effect: "Allow"
            Action:
              - "sts:AssumeRole"
            Principal:
              Service:
                - "lambda.amazonaws.com"
      Policies:
        - PolicyName: "GigsApiDynamoDBPolicy"
          PolicyDocument:
            Version: "2012-10-17"
            Statement:
              - Effect: "Allow"
                Action:
                  - "sqs:ReceiveMessage"
                  - "sqs:DeleteMessage"
                Resource: !GetAtt TicketPurchasedQueue.Arn
```

Add Lambda definition:

```yaml
SendMailWorker:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      CodeUri: ./src
      Handler: index.sendMailWorker
      Runtime: nodejs6.10
      Role: !GetAtt SendMailWorkerRole.Arn
      Environment:
        Variables:
          SQS_QUEUE_URL: !Ref TicketPurchasedQueue
          SMTP_HOST: !Ref SmtpHost
          SMTP_PORT: !Ref SmtpPort
          SMTP_SENDER_ADDRESS: !Ref SmtpSenderAddress
          SMTP_USERNAME: !Ref SmtpUsername
          SMTP_PASSWORD: !Ref SmtpPassword
      Events:
        Timer:
          Type: Schedule
          Properties:
            Schedule: rate(1 minute)
```

explain the schedule event


## 08.05 - Creating the lambda

First of all install new dependencies.

From `src`:

```bash
npm i --save nodemailer nodemailer-smtp-transport
```

Update `index.js`:

```javascript
//...

const nodemailer = require('nodemailer')
const smtpTransport = require('nodemailer-smtp-transport')

// ...

const sqs = new AWS.SQS()

// ...

exports.sendMailWorker = (event, context, callback) => {
  const receiveMessageParams = {
    QueueUrl: process.env.SQS_QUEUE_URL,
    MaxNumberOfMessages: 1
  }

  sqs.receiveMessage(receiveMessageParams, (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err)
      return callback(err)
    }

    if (!data.Messages) {
      console.log('no messages to process')
      return callback(null, 'no messages to process')
    }

    const message = data.Messages[0]

    // extract message data from sqs message
    // the double JSON parse is because the sqs message contains the original sns message
    // in the body, so we are basically extracting the data from the `Message` attribute
    // of the original sns message.
    const messageData = JSON.parse(JSON.parse(message.Body).Message)

    const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport(smtpTransport({
      host: process.env.SMTP_HOST,
      port: process.env.SMTP_PORT,
      auth: {
        user: process.env.SMTP_USERNAME,
        pass: process.env.SMTP_PASSWORD
      }
    }))

    const subject = `Your ticket for ${messageData.gig.bandName} in ${messageData.gig.city}`

    const content = `
Hey ${messageData.ticket.name},
you are going to see ${messageData.gig.bandName} in ${messageData.gig.city}!

This is the secret code that will give you access to our time travel collection point:

---
${messageData.ticket.id}
---

Be sure to show it to our staff at entrance.

Collection point is placed in ${messageData.gig.collectionPoint}.
Be sure to be there on ${messageData.gig.date} at ${messageData.gig.collectionTime}

We already look forward (or maybe backward) to having you there, it's going to be epic!

â€” Your friendly Ticketless staff

PS: remember that is forbidden to place bets or do any other action that might substantially
increase your net worth while time travelling. Travel safe!
`

    const mailOptions = {
      from: process.env.SMTP_SENDER_ADDRESS,
      to: messageData.ticket.email,
      subject,
      text: content
    }

    transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (err, info) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(err)
        return callback(err)
      }

      // delete message from queue
      const deleteMessageParams = {
        QueueUrl: process.env.SQS_QUEUE_URL,
        ReceiptHandle: message.ReceiptHandle
      }

      sqs.deleteMessage(deleteMessageParams, (err, data) => {
        if (err) {
          console.error(err)
          return callback(err)
        }

        console.log('1 message processed successfully')
        return callback(null, 'Completed')
      })
    })

// ...

```
