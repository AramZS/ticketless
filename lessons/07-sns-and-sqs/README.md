## Lesson 07 — SNS and SQS


### Goal

In this lesson we will learn how to use SNS to fire a generic event (a ticket was purchased) and how to register an SQS queue to listen for those events and store them for later processing.

If you are already familiar with those concepts you can use the following Cloudformation template to apply the changes expected by this lesson and move forward to the next lesson.

**TODO**: add Cloudformation template
